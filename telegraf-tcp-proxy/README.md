# Telegraf TCP Proxy
This is the HELM Chart for the (Digital Inspire) Telegraf TCP Proxy.

**NOTE that this section is still WIP because:**
- The telegraf tcp proxy first requires a `Dockerfile` to be created in/for the according repository
- The telegraf tcp proxy has to be build (by using the `Dockerfile`) and hosted on a docker registry (preferably [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/))
- The HELM Chart has to be crafted
